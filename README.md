**Text Spam Classifier**
This project is a machine learning-based web application that classifies messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam" using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project is built using Python, Streamlit for the web interface, and machine learning models for classification.
**Project Overview**
This application takes a text as input and predicts whether it is "Spam" or "Not Spam." The classification is done using a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages.

**Dataset**
The model is trained on the SMS Spam Collection dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains a set of labeled SMS messages tagged as "ham" (not spam) or "spam".
